#### Description
Developed as a part of the XPlatformer project, the *References* folder contains a series of helper classes and functions that act as wrappers for commonly used XLib functions or sequences of operations.   Specifically the framework assists in the handling of window operations, graphics context and visual drawing.   The framework more broadly assists in handling input, logging, mathematics and game organization.
